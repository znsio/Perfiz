# Gatling Html Reports

Apart from the [Live Grafana dashboards](/documentation/grafanaDashboards.markdown), perfiz also makes the Gatling html reports available to you after the test is done. These reports are located inside ```<your project root dir>/perfiz/gatling_data/results```.

Go to [Perfiz Demo](https://github.com/znsio/perfiz-demo) to see this in action after your run a test.
